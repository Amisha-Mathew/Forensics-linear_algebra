# Forensics-linear_algebra
A powerpoint presentation compiled after research on the applications of linear algebra and its concepts on forensics.

This project was a seminar conducted to explain how forensics and linear algebra are inter-connected and how forensics is impossible without it. Several activities like:

- Finding photographic evidence
- Human body image detection through CCTV, etc.
- Image construction and deblurring
- Accumulating data, etc.
- Fast DNA mixture analysis using GPUs

Make the use of basic concepts of linear combination, spanning set, and basis, etc.

The prerequisites required are:

- n dimension Euclidean space
- The set of mxn real matrices
- The set of polynomials of degree n or less
- The space of real-valued functions on the set of real numbers


Goals:

To explore the real-life applications of linear algebra and how it can be programmed into our daily lives. 
To emphasize the value of forensics by applying artificial intelligence through using mathematical notions of linear algebra.
